# ===============================

spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size=10
# ? Max number of DB connections allowed in the pool at once.
# Example: If 10 user requests hit at the same time, all 10 get a connection;
# the 11th request waits until one connection is released.

spring.datasource.hikari.minimum-idle=2
# ? Minimum number of idle (ready) connections to always keep open.
# Example: Even at midnight with no traffic, 2 connections stay alive
# so the next request connects instantly without setup delay.

spring.datasource.hikari.idle-timeout=30000
# ? Time (ms) after which an idle connection is closed if unused.
#If a connection is sitting unused for more than 30 seconds, Hikari can close it.
#But it will never go below minimum-idle.
#? Example:
#Pool has 10 open connections.
#Traffic drops ? 8 are idle for 30+ seconds.
#Hikari closes 6, keeps 2 (because min-idle=2).

spring.datasource.hikari.pool-name=PostgresHikariPool
# ? Custom name for the pool shown in logs and metrics.
# Example: Log shows ?PostgresHikariPool - Start completed?
# instead of ?HikariPool-1?, making it easier to identify.

spring.datasource.hikari.max-lifetime=600000
# ? Max lifetime (ms) of a connection before it?s recycled.
# Example: Every 10 minutes, old connections are replaced with fresh ones
# to prevent stale connections or database timeouts.
